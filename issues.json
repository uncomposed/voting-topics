We need to assume people will dismiss it immediately so methods to mitigate that risk should be emplaced, the way it is formatted and a button to open it up again once it has been closed.\n- [ ] in the view in the card view. We have a section that explains what a direction is but from a user perspective, it is not clear that we are using our own definition for the word direction and instead they read it as a synonym for instructions, which is confusing.\n- [ ] in the starter pack selection box, it should be more concise on what they should do e.g. select topics that are important to you to add to Your Preference Set.\n- [ ] We shouldn't say \"Your Topics\" at the front. if they receive a link from someone it should be clear that this is not theirs but if they want they can save a copy or clear/start from scratch.\n- [ ] \"Next\" Button is important. we need to be perscriptive about what the user should do with the site. how it can help them and what they should do next. We already have a pretty good idea and logical, but a subtly highlighted button isn't clear enough. I think we should maybe have the word \"next\" around it or pointing to it\n- [ ] in both card view and List view there are good descriptors for the different levels of star, one through five however zero stars does not have a description which is arguably one of the more important and confusing ratings in card view.
