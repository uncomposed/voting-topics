There would be at least three buttons on the NAV bar with an option for a fourth if the screen is wide enough. The button on the furthest right of the NAV bar will be the suggested next view for user to progress to. See the better user journey issue for more information. On that button, there will be a drop down or pop-up menu, depending on mobile or desktop, which will allow the user to navigate to the other views, preference, ballot, or compare, the Center button on the NAV bar will be dynamic based on the view the user is on e.g. the preference views Will present the new topic button or the jump to unfilled directions button. The last button on the NAV bar will always be the menu drop-down or pop-up. It will offer the rest of the buttons at all times to the user, except for a new topic, I'm thinking that shouldn't be a button available on all views.
